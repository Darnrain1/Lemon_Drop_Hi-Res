Known issues.

When using wired headphones the DAC needs to say on all the time, or you will have no audio and video will run slow. It's due to Hardware-Offloaded Audio Processing, in other words all the audio is routed through the ESS DAC. No software audio decoding on Lemon Drop Hi-Res, it's all hardware.
