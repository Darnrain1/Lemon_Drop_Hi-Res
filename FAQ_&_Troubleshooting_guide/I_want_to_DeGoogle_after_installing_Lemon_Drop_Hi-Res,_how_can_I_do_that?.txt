Yes you can, I will show you how to install microG. It's a free and open-source implementation of proprietary Google libraries, that serves as a replacement for Google Play Services.

Make sure your phone is all setup the way you like, before you DeGoogle. There is no rush, you can DeGoogle at any time. All your paid apps and games from the Play Store should run just fine with microG. You will still be able to download the free apps and games from the Play Store, just not your paid apps and games. In less you login via the Aurora Store with your Google account, but that is against Googles TOS, your account may get banned.

1. Only do this once. Copy all your contacts from your Google account to your sim card. Make sure your signed into Google Play Store, open up the phone app, choose Manage contacts, copy from your email address to your SIM card.

I am logged in as anonymous and the search does not work in Aurora Store?
Yes it's a known bug, open Auora Store sign in as anonymous, open Chromium, do a google search for like "Spotify Lite Play Store". The first link will say in the top left, Google Play. Just click on the link "Spotify Lite". You should get an option to open Aurora Store and set it as the default app. If you get an error "no such app found" or it loads F-droid, then go to settings, do a search for default. Click on Default apps, App links, Aurora Store, click on open supported links, change to ask every time.


Network Location not working with microG?
You have to install Apple UnifiedNlp backend from f-droid and enable it in microG under location modules, disable Deja Vu Location Serivce.


Push Notifications not working?
Clear all data on microG. Give it all the permissions it wants. Open microG and enable Google Device Registration. Wait 30 seconds, then restart your phone. Wait about 2 minutes, enable Cloud Messaging and Location Modules.


Text to speech is not working on my DeGoogled phone.
Install "Speech Services by Google" from the Aurora Store. It was removed automatically when you DeGoogled. Once you get Google Speech Services installed you can install the FOSS app RHVoice do a search for "Speech rate" to activate it.
