My camera does not work after Auto_Debloat?
If you were on LIneageOS or crDroid and then flashed Stock Oreo, then your camera may not work afterwords. The only fix that I know of is to root your phone again. Flash the KDZ to downgrade your firmware and root again.

Also if you want to save your battery from wear you can use BatteryBot Pro. You can set an alarm when charged is reached and you can see your battery level on the second screen with the screen off.

How do I format my sdcard for the Lgv20 & copy over my data?
Note: Formatting will delete all you data on your microsd card. So you may want to make a backup first before formatting.

I have found that it is best to format the sdcard in twrp.
Click on Wipe
Click Advanced Wipe
Check Mark Micro SD card
Click repair or Change file System
Click Change File System
Click on exFAT
Swipe to format

It's best to just Mount the Usb Storage in TWRP to copy over your data to you micro sd card. I was having issues with my sdcard reader in my laptop. I think it was corrupting the files on the sd card. This way you don't ever have to take your card out of your phone.
